# ShikaSwap - WoW Vanilla/Turtle Addon

**ShikaSwap** is an addon for World of Warcraft 1.12 (Vanilla/Turtle WoW) that automatically equips the correct libram when you cast Paladin spells.

> **Note**: This is a modified version of the original LibramSwap addon by Theo. I've rebuilt and enhanced it with my own features and improvements.

## 📋 Features

- ✅ **Automatic libram swapping** before casting spells
- ✅ **GCD-aware combat casting** (auto deferred cast after swap when needed)
- ✅ **Profile system** to save different configurations
- ✅ **Spell management** via Sorts Manager (Add/Remove)
- ✅ **Visual indicators** (green = libram in bags, red = missing)
- ✅ **Auto-load** last used profile on login
- ✅ **Intuitive interface** with dropdowns and checkboxes

## 🔄 Patch Status

This addon has been modified recently due to a patch and behavior updates.

- Some options are still under active testing
- Combat timing behavior can vary depending on latency and client state
- Future updates may adjust combat-related toggles for better reliability

## 🎮 Installation

1. Download the addon (green "Code" button → "Download ZIP")
2. Extract the `Libramswap-main` folder
3. Rename it to `LibramSwap`
4. Place it in: `World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/LibramSwap`
5. Restart WoW or type `/reload` in-game

## ⚠️ Important - Macro Requirements

**For proper functionality, you MUST use macros for the following spells:**

The addon needs the **exact spell rank** to work correctly. Create macros for these spells:

### Required Macros

**Holy Strike:**
```
#showtooltip Holy Strike
/cast Holy Strike(Rank X)
```

**Holy Shield:**
```
#showtooltip Holy Shield
/cast Holy Shield(Rank X)
```

**Consecration:**
```
#showtooltip Consecration
/cast Consecration(Rank X)
```

**Flash of Light:**
```
#showtooltip Flash of Light
/cast Flash of Light(Rank X)
```

**Holy Light:**
```
#showtooltip Holy Light
/cast Holy Light(Rank X)
```

> **Note**: Replace `Rank X` with your actual spell rank (e.g., `Rank 5`, `Rank 6`, etc.)

### Why Macros Are Needed

The game client doesn't always provide the spell rank when you cast directly from your action bar. Using macros ensures ShikaSwap can:
- Identify the exact spell being cast
- Equip the correct libram before casting
- Work reliably in all situations

**Without macros**, these spells may not trigger the libram swap!

## 🔧 Advanced Options

### Swap Delay
- Adjust the delay between libram swap and spell cast
- Recommended value: **0.02 seconds**

### GCD Behavior
- In combat, if the libram swap and cast cannot happen safely in the same instant, ShikaSwap queues a short deferred cast
- This helps the spell fire right after swap/GCD timing without requiring extra key presses

### Try same-tick (Experimental)
- The **Try same-tick** option is currently experimental
- It is not fully reliable yet and may fail in some combat situations
- If you encounter unstable behavior, disable this option and use standard deferred casting

### Debug
- Enable it from the configuration window to see detailed messages in chat
- Useful for troubleshooting

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: The addon doesn't load my librams on login?**  
A: Make sure you clicked "Save" after configuring your spells. The profile must be saved to auto-load.

**Q: Dropdowns are empty after `/reload`?**  
A: This means the profile was created before configuring librams. Configure your spells, then click "Save" to overwrite the profile.

**Q: How do I know which profile is active?**  
A: Type `/ssikaprofile` to see the active profile and number of configured spells.

**Q: The addon doesn't swap in combat?**  
A: For safety, the addon won't swap if your cursor has an item or a transaction window is open.

**Q: How do I create multiple profiles (Heal/Tank/PvP)?**  
A: Configure spells for one role, save the profile with a name (e.g., "Heal"). Change configuration, save with another name (e.g., "Tank"). Load the desired profile as needed.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Swap may fail if you spam the spell too quickly (use the delay setting)
- Some librams require exact name matching (case-sensitive)
- **Try same-tick** is not fully functional yet and is still being tested

## 👨‍💻 Development

This project is open-source. Contributions are welcome!

There is no build pipeline for this addon. Validate changes in-game by reloading the UI with `/reload` and then exercising the affected configuration or spell flow.
